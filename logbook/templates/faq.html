		<li class = "answer">Logbooks are a handy way of sorting your volunteer hours and saving you time while logging them. Every organization you volunteer for should have a seperate logbook.</li>
		<li class = "question">How do I log my hours to be approved by my supervisor?</li>
		<li class = "answer">Once you have created a logbook for an organisation, you will be able to click on the name of this book. This 'opens' the logbook and gives you options to add entries which are the times you have volunteered for this organisation.</li>
		<li class = "question">What should I do if my supervisor isn't on the system yet?</li>
		<li class = "answer">If your supervisor is not yet on the system, but plans to use it in the future, you can log your hours as normal, and your supervisor will be able to approve them once they have an account. If your supervisor does not plan to use the system, then you will have to log your hours physically.</li>
